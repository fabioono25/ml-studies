## Studies about Machine Learning

### Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline that involves **cleaning**, **transforming**, and **organizing raw data** into a format suitable for training and evaluating machine learning models. The quality of the input data significantly impacts the performance and generalization ability of the model. Here are some key aspects of data preprocessing:

* Data Cleaning: how to handle missing values and outliers.
* Data Transformation: feature scaling (standardize/normalize numerical features), one-hot encoding (convert categorical values into binary matrix).
* Data Reduction: techniques to retain essential information, sampling.
* Data Organization: splitting the database (training and validation), time-based splitting.

Effective data preprocessing is essential for building robust and accurate machine learning models. It requires a good understanding of the specific characteristics of the dataset and the requirements of the
chosen machine learning algorithm. Iterative refinement of the preprocessing steps is often necessary to achieve optimal results.



### Regression

Regression is a statistical method used in machine learning to model the relationship between a **dependent variable (target)** and **one or more independent variables (features)**. The goal of regression is to learn a mathematical function that can **predict the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables**. It is commonly employed for tasks such as predicting numerical outcomes, estimating relationships between variables, and understanding the impact of input features on the target variable.

**Use Cases:** Regression is well-suited for tasks where the output is a continuous numerical value. For example, predicting house prices, stock prices, or temperature.

**Strengths:** It's effective when the goal is to estimate or predict a quantity within a range of values.



### Classification

Classification is a machine learning task that involves **assigning predefined labels or categories to input data** based on its features. The goal is to learn a model that can accurately predict the class of new, unseen instances. In classification, the **target variable is categorical**, and the algorithm aims to map input features to discrete classes or labels. Common examples include spam detection (classifying emails as spam or not), image recognition (assigning objects to specific categories), and medical diagnosis (categorizing patients into disease classes). The primary objective is to build a model capable of making **accurate predictions and generalizing well to unseen data**.

**Use Cases:** Classification is suitable for problems where the goal is to categorize input data into predefined classes or labels. Examples include spam detection, image recognition, or sentiment analysis.

**Strengths:** It excels at assigning discrete labels to data, making it valuable for tasks involving categorization and decision-making.
