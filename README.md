## Studies about Machine Learning

### Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline that involves **cleaning**, **transforming**, and **organizing raw data** into a format suitable for training and evaluating machine learning models. The quality of the input data significantly impacts the performance and generalization ability of the model. Here are some key aspects of data preprocessing:

* Data Cleaning: how to handle missing values and outliers.
* Data Transformation: feature scaling (standardize/normalize numerical features), one-hot encoding (convert categorical values into binary matrix).
* Data Reduction: techniques to retain essential information, sampling.
* Data Organization: splitting the database (training and validation), time-based splitting.

Effective data preprocessing is essential for building robust and accurate machine learning models. It requires a good understanding of the specific characteristics of the dataset and the requirements of the
chosen machine learning algorithm. Iterative refinement of the preprocessing steps is often necessary to achieve optimal results.
